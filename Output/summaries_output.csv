If reflected, the expenses shown would be higher. The Fund seeks investment results that track the total return of the common stocks that comprise the Standard &amp; Poors (S&amp;P) 500 ® Index (the Benchmark Index). The bar chart and table below provide an indication of the risk of investment in the Fund by showing changes in the performance of the Funds Initial Class for the last ten calendar years and by comparing the Funds average annual total return to the performance of a broad-based securities market index. The returns shown below are historical and are not an indication of future performance. Total return figures assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions and include the effect of the Funds recurring expenses, but do not include fees and expenses of any Permitted Account. If those fees and expenses were reflected, the performance shown would have been lower. Updated performance information may be obtained at www.greatwestfunds.com (the web site does not form a part of this Prospectus). The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds turnover rate was 4% of the average value of its portfolio. The following is a summary of the principal investment risks of investing in the Fund: Derivative Risk - Using derivatives can disproportionately increase losses and reduce opportunities for gains when stock prices, currency rates or interest rates are changing. The Fund may not fully benefit from or may lose money on derivatives if changes in their value do not correspond accurately to changes in the value of the Funds holdings. The other parties to certain derivative contracts present the same types of credit risk as issuers of fixed income securities. Derivatives can also make a fund less liquid and harder to value, especially in declining markets. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Risk - An ETF is subject to the risks associated with direct ownership of the securities comprising the index on which the ETF is based. Fund shareholders indirectly bear their proportionate share of the expenses of the ETFs in which the Fund invests. Lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in it being more volatile. Index Risk - It is possible the Benchmark Index may perform unfavorably and/or underperform the market as a whole. Investment Style Risk - There is a possibility that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Management Risk - A strategy used by the portfolio managers may fail to produce the intended results. Market Risk - Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market or economic developments in the U.S. and in other countries. Market risk may affect a single company, sector of the economy or the market as a whole. Tracking Error Risk - The Fund may not be able to precisely track the performance of the Benchmark Index. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit with a bank, is not insured, endorsed or guaranteed by the FDIC or any government agency, and is subject to possible loss of your original investment. The Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in common stocks included in its Benchmark Index. The Fund will seek investment results that track the total return of the common stocks that comprise the Benchmark Index by owning the securities contained in the Benchmark Index in as close as possible a proportion of the Fund as each stocks weight in the Benchmark Index. This may be accomplished through ownership of all the stocks in the Benchmark Index and/or through a combination of stock ownership and owning futures contracts on the Benchmark Index and options on futures contracts, and exchange-traded funds that seek to track the Benchmark Index. The Benchmark Index is the S&amp;P 500 ® Index. The S&amp;P 500 ® Index is a market capitalization-weighted index of the 500 leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy.

Because there is no calendar-year performance information for the S&#38;P 500 ETF, the information presented in the bar chart and table reflects the performance of the Investor Shares of Vanguard 500 Index. (Investor Shares are offered through a separate prospectus.) Performance based on net asset value for the ETF Shares Shares would be substantially similar because both share classes constitute an investment in the same portfolio of securities; their returns generally should differ only to the extent that the expenses of the two classes differ. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund's Investor Shares has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the Investor Shares compare with those of the Fund's target index, which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund.

The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold Investor Shares or Admiral Shares of the Fund. The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large-capitalization stocks. The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or 'turns over' its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 5%. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund's performance could be hurt by: Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.

Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy S&#38;P 500 ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares. Although S&#38;P 500 ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained. Trading of S&#38;P 500 ETF Shares on NYSE Arca may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide 'circuit breakers' (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified percentage).

The following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. Because the Fund&#8217;s Institutional Select Shares have not yet begun operations, the information presented in the bar chart and table reflects the performance of the Admiral&#8482; Shares of Vanguard 500 Index Fund. (Admiral Shares are offered through a separate prospectus.) Performance of the Fund&#8216;s Institutional Select Shares would be substantially similar to that of the Admiral Shares because both share classes constitute an investment in the same portfolio of securities; their returns generally should differ only to the extent that the expenses of the two share classes differ. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund&#8216;s Admiral Shares has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the Admiral Shares compare with those of the Fund&#8216;s target index, which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund. Keep in mind that the Fund&#8217;s past performance (before and after taxes) does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our website at vanguard.com/performance or by calling Vanguard toll-free at 800-662-7447. Actual after-tax returns depend on your tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table. When after-tax returns are calculated, it is assumed that the shareholder was in the highest individual federal marginal income tax bracket at the time of each distribution of income or capital gains or upon redemption. State and local income taxes are not reflected in the calculations. Please note that after-tax returns are shown only for the Investor Shares and may differ for each share class. After-tax returns are not relevant for a shareholder who holds fund shares in a tax-deferred account, such as an individual retirement account or a 401(k) plan. Also, figures captioned Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares may be higher than other figures for the same period if a capital loss occurs upon redemption and results in an assumed tax deduction for the shareholder. The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or &#8220;turns over&#8221; its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense examples, reduce the Fund&#8217;s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate was 3% of the average value of its portfolio. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the Funds share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Funds performance: ? Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Funds target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the Fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the Funds target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector. ? Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing betteror worsethan other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Because ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to additional risks: ? The Funds ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the market price of an ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value (NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy ETF Shares on the secondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell those shares. ? Although the Funds ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained. ? Trading of the Funds ETF Shares may be halted by the activation of individual or marketwide trading halts (which halt trading for a specific period of time when the price of a particular security or overall market The Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard &amp; Poor&#8216;s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.",6053,The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold Investor Shares or Admiral Shares of the Fund.,130,37,289,1.0
